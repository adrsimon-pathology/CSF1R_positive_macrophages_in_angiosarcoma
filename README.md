Additional supplementary material to the publication "Immune cell clustering identifies a CD163⁺/CSF1R⁺ macrophage and neutrophil-enriched phenotype with distinct biological signatures and poor prognosis in angiosarcoma" by Adrian G. Simon et al.

A detailed description of the mass spectrometry workflow is provided in the Supplementary Data (Supplementary Materials and Methods). The raw liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD070528.
Clinicopathological data are available upon reasonable request from the corresponding author (A.G.Simon).
